# Canadian Heritage's Research Portal
The aim of this project is to design and develop Canadian Heritage's fully customized Research portal on GCPedia. 

## Research
A good starting point: http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/GCbootstrap/start-eng
- Components can be created using double brackets `{{head}}`
- Consider adding core GCpedia functions, or alternative for future-proofing (search, edit source, etc.)
- Mobile View

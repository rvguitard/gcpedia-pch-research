# Canadian Heritage's Research Portal
The aim of this project is to design and develop Canadian Heritage's fully customized Research portal on GCPedia. 

## Research
The functionality of the PCH Research Portal is based off [GCBootstrap](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/GCbootstrap/start-eng), and then visually customized with custom styles. If you're looking to build your own page based off our branding, please follow the guidelines.

## Design
Figma projects are used to wireframe, map and design the portal's user interface.

## Building Your PCH Research GCpedia Page
1. The first step to building your own web page would be to learn the way GCpedia manages its content. Visit the [How to Create a new page]http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Help:Create_a_new_page to quickly create your desired page on GCpedia.
2. Our method utilizes GCpedia as a hosting service and simply overwrites the face of the page by plastering content on top of the Wiki. Keeping the basic functionality of the wiki but enabling us to customize its styles.

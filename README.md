# Canadian Heritage's Research Portal
The aim of this project is to design and develop Canadian Heritage's fully customized Research portal on GCPedia. 

## Research
The functionality of the PCH Research Portal is based off [GCBootstrap](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/GCbootstrap/start-eng), and then visually customized with custom styles. 


## Design
Figma projects are used to wireframe, map and design the portal's user interface.

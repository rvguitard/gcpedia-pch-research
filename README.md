# Canadian Heritage's Research Portal
The aim of this project is to design and develop Canadian Heritage's fully customized Research portal on GCPedia. 
## Building Your PCH Research GCpedia Page
1. The first step to building your own web page would be to learn the way GCpedia manages its content. Visit the [How to Create a new page](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Help:Create_a_new_page) to obtain your URL on GCpedia.
2. Our method utilizes GCpedia as a hosting service and simply overwrites the face of the page by plastering content on top, keeping the basic functionalities of the wiki, but allowing us to customize its styles accordingly.
